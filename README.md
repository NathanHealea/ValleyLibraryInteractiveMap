How-to


Navigation -  Navigating between two points 

Click on the beginning location and in the tooltip select start location.
Click on the destination and in the tooltip select the end destination.
Then in the side bar click start and a line will appear from one location to the next.

Navigation – changing the grids

Once you login, click on the navigation tab
Click on the “Walkable” button. This will allow you to designate squares on the grid as a walkable path. 
If you want to designate a non-walkable area, click on the “Unwalkable” and mark the locations on the grid. 

The black locations on the grid are all the entry points for the rooms. They should all be connected. 

You can test a path by selecting the “Test” button, and then clicking on two grid squares. A line will be drawn if there is an available path between the two selected points. Hit “Clear” to clear. 

Hit save to save the grid. It will now be used on the home page for navigation for that floor.
